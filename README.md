    EQ Bank

    EQ Bank was incorporated in 2016. It is the digital banking arm of Equitable Bank which was founded in 1970 as The Equitable Trust Company.

* Who are the founders of the company?
 
    Equitable Group Inc.
* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

    EQ Bank is Canada's first challenger bank (no brick and mortar locations) where all of their banking services are within the digital banking space. As the name 'Challenger Bank' says for itself, it has grown in a space that the top banks of Canada were not enganging in fully and placing itself as a leader in provider personal and commercial financial services at the comfort of their customer's homes. With no branchs or costly overhear, EQ Bank is able to investment more resources into better interest rates and ultimaly be more customer-centred in their operations. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
   
    EQ Bank was primarily funded by it's parent company Equitable Group Inc. It is also a publically traded company at the Toronto Stock Exchange as EQB.

## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
    
    
    The company is solving the issue of requiring customers to visit a physical branch in order to receive financial services (e.g. open a bank account, investing and lending). 

    Offering customers hassle free, low-fee banking, easy access, higher interest rate savings, financial wellbeing as advise. Diverse suite residential lending, commercial lending, deposit products (high interest savings accounts and GICs). 


* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

    The company's intented customer is the individual that is a fast adopter of technology, accustomed to using online banking products, desire to better their financial wellbeing and is not bothered by the limitations of an online banking platform. Their priority is having their financial needs met while adding convenience and simplicity to their banking services.

    The digital arm of EQ Bank benefits greatly from their parent company Equitable Bank which is 9th largest domestic bank in Canada. It is difficult to find specific market-size information related to EQ Bank as  they fall under the same umbrella. The digital platform has helped to further extend Equitable Bank's market size within the Canadian finance sector.


* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

    Without the cost associated with physical branch locations, EQ Bank's rental footprint is signficantly lower than it's competitors which provides them the opportunity to focus their resources in other areas to attract/retain their customers. 

    One solution offered by EQ Bank is their decision to only provide customers with a high-interest savings account which acts as both their open savings account and chequing account. This helps to streamline customer's money management and challenges the idea that a bank account requires a savings and chequing account. The savings account allows for customers to continously earn interest on their funds while being able to withdraw funds as required.

    EQ Bank utilizes their partnership with other fintech companies in order to provide their customers with competitive products. One strategic partership is with TransferWire that allows customers to easity send money abroad using their EQ Bank account. TransferWise is a global online money transfer platform that allows customers to transfer money abroad at the lowest possible true cost. Most importantly, EQ Bank customers can also take advantage of quick speed transfer (approximately three business days). EQ Bank has integrated TransferWise's API directly into their banking platform which makes the international transfer option very easy to use for customers.

    Customers want an easy, fast, and secure banking experience. EQ Bank is meeting these needs by providing solutions that allow customers to quickly and easily have access to their money, move money between banks, and purchase new products.
    

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

    EB Bank is currently using the following technologies within their banking platform:
    * TransferWise's API that is integrated within their banking platform to allow for customers to send and receive international funds.
    * Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to market consumer-facing offerings: marketing strategies, automate customer support, fraud dectection measures, customer data management, risk modelling for investments
    * front-to-back office software from Temenows - T24 Transact (core banking)
    * Temenos Connect/Inifity (front-end channels)
    

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

    Digital Banking. Other terms used: Neo Banking, and Personal Finance/Deposits/Online Banking.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

    Over the years, we have seen the digital banking domain ultimate redefine the expectations of banks by changing customer's priorities. According to EY's 2019 Global FinTech Adoption trends survey, the Canadian FinTech adoption rate has seen signifacant growth over the past 5 years - 8% in 2015, 18% in 2017 to 50% in 2019. Some of the biggest appeals for digital bankings services include the technology-forward mindset, personalization from customer-to-customer, accessibility, transparency, frictionless and cost-effective measures in place.

    Digital banking is able to provide customers with a frictionless experience compared to a traditional bank by providing customers an easy process of setting up an account, operating costs are not transferred to the customer via fees, and their ability to offer competitve rates. 

    Some of the major trends and innovations that have occured within the digital banking domain include: 
     1) Money Transers and Payments - faster and easier access to funds. Reduced fees.

    2) Savings and investment - High-interest savings accounts and competitive GIC investment options readily available for customers to add to their portfolio.
    
    3) Online Banking Platform  - Customers are able to open accounts without provider physical proof of their identity. Customer's identities are verified through government issued identity (e.g. Social Insurance number) and using credit reporting/agencies/ultilities/telecommunication providers to approve an account opening.
    
* What are the other major companies in this domain?

    Zafin, Tangerine, VersaBank, NorthOne, and Zagbank.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

    Early June 2020, EQ Bank announcemed it has surpassed $3 Billion (CAN) in deposits which is a strong indication of customer growth. They have been able to succesfully penetrate the Canadian financial sector where the biggest banks have relied on their bric and mortar/physical pressence  in order to attract customers and receive legitamacy. 

    EQ Bank has positioned themselves as a financial institution that is heavily relies on their ability in fast adoption of technologies to streamline financial services and market themselves as a viable option for Canadians wanting more from their financial institution. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

    EB Bank continues to measure its success in the same metrics as traditional banks and enhancing technologies. Based on Equitable Bank's 2019 Corporate Reports, the overarching metrics for EQ Bank include:
    * consumer growth by 24,500 or 35% to over 95,000
    * increased deposits
    * Launching an international money transfer service 
    * enhancing customer servic with website modernization and upgrade of onboarding, mobile, and web functionality 
    * TV and digital marketing campaign

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

    EB Bank is performing relatively strong to its competitors within the same domain. EQ Bank has been able to attract customers with their competitive savings accounts and ability to transfer funds easily (domestic and internationally).

    However, the domain has expanded to include digital arms of traditional banks. One example is Tangerine (subsidiary of Scotiabank, formerly ING Direct) which provides similar banking services to EQ Bank. Tangerine’s services also include credit card options, registered savings accounts (TFSA, RRSP and RRIF), and loan options (e.g. personal mortgages).

    By comparing two dominant digital banks with the Canadian sector, EQ Bank has an opportunity to expand their services for customers to include additional day-to-day banking options. EQ Bank does not offer registered savings accounts and issues physical debit cards. These additional products can attract another group of customers that are looking for a digital banking platform with a wide range of products.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

    My Recommendation: implement Robo-Adviser & Expand investment options

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

    robo-advisors provide automated, algorithm-driven financial planning services with little to no human supervision. Robo-advisors can use customer information and future goals through online surveys to automate financial advice. I believe this additional feature will greatly benefit the company and compliment its current savings products.  

    The investment options with EQ should also include registered-savings accounts (e.g. TFSA, RRSP, RRIF) to encourage customers to deposit their long-term funds with EQ Bank. Currently, the investment options at EQ Bank are only for non-registered investments. By adding these saving options, EQ Bank can cater to an array of saving plans (short term and long term).

    By incorporating the use of Robo-Advisors, EQ Bank will continue to provide in a direction where their interest lies in growing customer wealth customers and showcasing their ability to offer products and services that their competition is not fulfilling. As deposits at EQ Bank continue grow, their next steps should be retaining those deposits.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

    *Machine Learning
    *Artificial Intelligence
    *Automation

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

    These technologies are appropriate for my solution as they are using client data and survey to provide customers with personalized financial advice. The recommendations provided are based on the individual rather than outputting a general recommendation.

 

As a digital bank, EB Bank can use technology to establish a connection with their customers by offering competitive products and creating a recommended portfolio for their customers based on their financial goals. Ultimately showcasing the benefits of digital banking
